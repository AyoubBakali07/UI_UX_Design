# Problem Definition

## Context
Trainers face challenges in effectively tracking students' progress in self-training programs, particularly in tutorials and projects. Currently, the tools used, such as Google Sheets, are insufficient to provide a clear and structured view.

## Problem
- Trainers lack clear visibility into individual students' progress.
- They do not know which students are encountering problems or falling behind.
- It is difficult to identify the reasons for delays in tutorials or projects.
